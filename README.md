Project topic 2:

Develop a website for a hypothetical community volunteering service center where volunteers can sign up for the tasks listed on the web site. There will be one administrator account with privileges to create volunteering tasks. Once created those tasks will be listed on the web site. Each task entry will provide the details of the task (time, location, how many people needed etc.). The volunteers can sign up for the individual tasks that they pick. They should be able to remove or modify their selections. The administrator should be able to see and control who signed up to the task teams.In minimum, your design should provide the features described above. You can add additional features as well. 

In addition, you need to provide some graphics, logos, and other visual elements to enrich the web site. The design should look professional. Your website should be hosted on a server ( a PHP and MySQL capable server is needed. More instruction will be provided on that soon). The instructor should be able to visit your web site solution by using a browser and Internet connection. You will also upload a zip folder that contains your files to Canvas using the assignment entry that is allocated to the project submissions.

Projects will be conducted as a team.  Each team has a group area on canvas. A discussion board is provided to help you to communicate with your team.
